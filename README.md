# General Exchange Project

Based on [OldSchool Runescape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/) G.E, this project aims to simulate the Grand Exchange system, allowing users to buy and sell items in a virtual marketplace. The project is designed to be modular and extensible, making it easy to add new features and functionality as needed.

The project aims to do this using API, as a way to sharpen our skills in API development.
